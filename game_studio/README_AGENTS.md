# Evolve Game Studio - AI Agents

This directory contains AI agents that can help modify and enhance the Evolve game based on user requests.

## Overview

The agent system consists of:

1. **Game Developer Agent**: Makes changes to existing game code to implement new features or modify existing ones.
2. **Artist Agent**: Generates game assets (characters, enemies, weapons, items, terrain) using the evolve.py commands.
3. **Agent Coordinator**: Orchestrates the work between the two agents to fulfill user requests.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Anthropic API key (for Claude)
- Required Python packages:
  - anthropic
  - requests
  - pathlib

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install anthropic requests
```

## Setup

1. Set your Anthropic API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Alternatively, you can pass the API key directly when running the agent coordinator.

## Usage

### Using the Agent Coordinator

The Agent Coordinator is the main entry point for processing user requests. It will:
1. Analyze the request using both agents
2. Implement code changes if needed
3. Generate assets if needed
4. Save a detailed report of the changes

```bash
python game_studio/agent_coordinator.py "I wish there was a flaming axe in the game"
```

You can also provide your API key directly:

```bash
python game_studio/agent_coordinator.py "I wish there was a flaming axe in the game" --api-key your_api_key_here
```

### Example Requests

Here are some example requests you can try:

- "I wish there was a flaming axe in the game"
- "Add a zombie enemy that moves slowly but is hard to kill"
- "Create a health potion that restores 50 health points"
- "Add a desert terrain with cactus obstacles"
- "Make the player character move faster"

## How It Works

1. **Request Analysis**:
   - The Game Developer Agent analyzes the request to determine what code changes are needed
   - The Artist Agent analyzes the request to determine what assets need to be generated

2. **Code Modification**:
   - The Game Developer Agent reads relevant game files
   - It identifies specific code sections that need to be modified
   - It makes precise changes to implement the requested feature

3. **Asset Generation**:
   - The Artist Agent determines what assets are needed
   - It constructs appropriate commands for evolve.py
   - It executes these commands to generate the assets

4. **Results**:
   - A summary of changes is displayed in the console
   - A detailed JSON report is saved in the game_studio directory

## Customization

### Game Developer Agent

The Game Developer Agent looks at a default set of game files when analyzing requests. You can customize this list in the `_get_default_game_files` method of the `GameDeveloperAgent` class.

### Artist Agent

The Artist Agent is configured with knowledge of the available asset generation commands. If new commands are added to evolve.py, you should update the prompt in the `analyze_request` method of the `ArtistAgent` class.

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues

If you encounter errors related to the API key:
- Make sure your Anthropic API key is valid
- Check that the environment variable is set correctly
- Try passing the API key directly using the --api-key parameter

### File Not Found Errors

If the Game Developer Agent can't find files to modify:
- Check that the paths in `_get_default_game_files` are correct
- Make sure you're running the script from the project root directory

### Asset Generation Errors

If asset generation fails:
- Check that evolve.py is working correctly
- Verify that the commands generated by the Artist Agent are valid
- Look at the error messages in the JSON report for specific issues
