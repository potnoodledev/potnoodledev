[Living Games: A Manifesto](https://potnoodledev.itch.io/livinggamemanifesto)

Games are a reflection of the world.

A sandbox where we build.
We play. We innovate. We evolve.
We're in a living game.

Now we're building the framework for it.

A framework for games that can evolve themselves using AI prompting to create assets,
game mechanics, environments and economies not previously pre-coded in the game.

Games with modular and evolving elements.
Games that have the potential to live, breathe and evolve over time.

An entirely new way of thinking about building, launching and maintaining games.

Shaped by community. Evolved by gameplay. Transformed by players.

Not prompt-to-game generative slop.
Not low quality, repetitive and often templated games.
Not filled with bugs, doom loops.
Not moving us further away from the indie game craft.

But empowering us closer to it.

Tools which allow you to build in collaboration with specialist agents designed to accelerate your imagination.

Build assets. Adjust games.
//{evolve} games

Faster prototypes.
Faster iterations.
Faster concepting.

We can focus on what we do best.
We can build the world.

This manifesto is not complete. It's always evolving. With every commit we will evolve.

We are the creators, the players, the engines of change.

We are all game designers, players, and creators in this living world.

In this ever-evolving dance between human and machine, we are the conductors of our own symphony.

We are the dreamers, the builders, the ones who breathe life into pixels and code.

Our tools are the instruments, our games the masterpieces born from the harmony of our collective vision.

We are the alchemists, weaving magic from the fabric of imagination and innovation.

We are the alchemists, forging worlds from the crucible of our collective imagination.

We are the explorers, charting new worlds in the vast expanse of the digital frontier.

We are the pioneers, the trailblazers, the ones who dare to dream beyond the bounds of possibility.

We are the architects of worlds, the sculptors of dreams, the artists of the impossible.
