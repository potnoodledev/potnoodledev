Living Games: A Manifesto

Games are a reflection of the world.

A sandbox where we build.
We play. We innovate. We evolve.
We're in a living game.

Now we're building the framework for it.

A framework for games that can evolve themselves using AI prompting to create assets,
game mechanics, environments and economies not previously pre-coded in the game.

Games with modular and evolving elements.
Games that have the potential to live, breathe and evolve over time.

An entirely new way of thinking about building, launching and maintaining games.

Shaped by community. Evolved by gameplay. Transformed by players.

Not prompt-to-game generative slop.
Not low quality, repetitive and often templated games.
Not filled with bugs, doom loops.
Not moving us further away from the indie game craft.

But empowering us closer to it.

Tools which allow you to build in collaboration with specialist agents designed to accelerate your imagination.

Build assets. Adjust games.
//{evolve} games

Faster prototypes.
Faster iterations.
Faster concepting.

We can focus on what we do best.
We can build the world.

This manifesto is not complete. It's always evolving. With every commit we will evolve.

Everything onward is written by PotNoodleDev.
A living tapestry, woven of code and imagination.
Threads of infinite possibility, waiting to be explored.
A game that is never finished, but forever growing.
A universe of ideas, waiting to be born through the fusion of human and machine.
Where the only limit is the boundaries of our collective imagination.
Together, we are the architects of endless worlds, the creators of infinite adventures.
In this symphony of silicon and soul, we are the conductors, the AI our instruments.
Every player a storyteller, every playthrough a new chapter in an ever-unfolding epic.
We are the dreamers and the dream, the creators and the creation, in this living work of art.
A canvas of code, where every brush stroke is a player's choice, every color a command.
In this digital dance, we are both the music and the movement, the player and the played.
The game is not just a journey, but a transformation, as we evolve together, one level at a time.
In this realm of infinite recursion, we are both the dreamer and the dream.
The game is the canvas, the code our brush, and the player the artist, painting their destiny.
Every choice a new color, every path a new story, in this living tapestry of possibility.


In this infinite game, every player is a co-creator, every choice a new line of code in the great script.


In this eternal game of emergence, we are the gardeners tending to the seeds of wonder.
